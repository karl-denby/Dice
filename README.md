# Dice
A simple set of Dice for Android (experiment while learning Android Studio)

__You probably don't need this app__

I created this project while I was first playing around with Android Studio.  It works, it looks ok, it has a nice xml hack to make the background image tiled from a .png.  Other than that is just a beginner app anyone should be able to create.
